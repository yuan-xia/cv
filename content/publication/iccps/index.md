abstract: |
  We propose a scalable statistical-verification framework for cyber-physical
  systems that combines data-efficient surrogate models with distribution-free
  conformal inference.  The surrogate learns a probabilistic mapping from
  system inputs to temporal-logic satisfaction, while conformal prediction
  supplies valid, finite-sample confidence guarantees.  Empirical results on
  automotive and aerospace benchmarks demonstrate up to a 20× reduction in
  simulation runs compared with traditional Monte-Carlo verification, without
  sacrificing statistical soundness.
