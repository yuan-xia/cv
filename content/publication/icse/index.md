abstract: |
  This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of defects in
  autonomous-vehicle (AV) software.  By mining issue trackers, commit logs, and
  crash reports from major AV projects, we compile a catalog of 700+ bugs and
  classify them along dimensions such as sensor modality, perception pipeline
  stage, and triggering environmental factors.  Our analysis uncovers common
  root causes—including data-race conditions in real-time middleware and
  over-trust in machine-learning confidence scores—and highlights gaps in
  existing testing practices.  We also release **AV-BugBench**, an open
  benchmark with reproducible failing scenarios to foster future research on
  AV reliability.
