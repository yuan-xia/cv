abstract: |
  We present a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
  automatically discover informative predicates and synthesize high-quality
  augmented data for learning likely program invariants.
  By integrating LLM-generated predicate suggestions with targeted trace
  sampling, our approach improves classifier accuracy and generalization while
  reducing manual feature-engineering effort. Extensive experiments on a suite
  of benchmark programs demonstrate that our method yields tighter invariants
  than state-of-the-art template-based and decision-tree learners, often with
  an order-of-magnitude reduction in training samples.
