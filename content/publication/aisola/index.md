abstract: |
  We present a systematic pipeline that converts free-form natural language
  descriptions of robot tasks into Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications.
  Leveraging large language models for semantic parsing, plus a formal
  post-processing stage that enforces syntactic and semantic STL constraints,
  our approach yields machine-verifiable goals from unstructured instructions.
  Experiments on a diverse benchmark of household-robot scenarios show a
  significant improvement in translation accuracy and downstream task
  execution success over existing rule-based methods.
