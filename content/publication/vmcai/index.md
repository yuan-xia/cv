abstract: |
  We introduce a runtime-monitoring–driven framework for automatically
  discovering inductive invariants in distributed systems.  By collecting
  lightweight execution traces and iteratively synthesizing classifiers that
  separate observed states from speculative unreachable states, our method
  produces invariants that are both precise and probabilistically sound.
  Experimental results on a suite of distributed protocols show that the
  approach scales to large state spaces and uncovers tight invariants that
  elude traditional template-based learners.
