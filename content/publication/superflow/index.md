abstract: |
  Network security analysts collect information ranging from coarse‐grained
  traffic summaries to fine‐grained packet contents, validating those data
  against expected patterns and known indicators of compromise.  The volume of
  modern network traffic, however, vastly exceeds analysts’ capacity for
  effective forensic inspection.  Motivated by the way packets are grouped
  into flows, we introduce **superflows**—an analyst-defined aggregation of
  one or more flows that share a common hypothesis about traffic behavior.
  We formalize the superflow construct, present practical representations and
  construction rules, and demonstrate through a case study how superflows can
  dramatically reduce the data that must be examined, thereby increasing
  Events Per Analyst Hour (EPAH).
