abstract: |
  We propose a conformal-inference–based framework for **statistical
  verification** of cyber-physical systems (CPS) operating under parametric
  uncertainty.  The method trains **surrogate models** on simulation data to
  predict satisfaction of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and uses
  conformal prediction to provide finite-sample probabilistic guarantees.
  A Gaussian-process–driven refinement procedure further yields localized
  assurance regions in the parameter space.  Experiments on autonomous-vehicle
  and aerospace benchmarks demonstrate substantial reductions in simulation
  cost while preserving rigorous statistical soundness.
